# News Site

I made a newssite for covering youth culture in the local area of Malm√∂-Copenhagen as well as online. I belive there is a void for news coverage that is non biased towards people with influence and at the same time is fun to read.

This assignment by Technigo was to build a newssite with headline news and some smaller news. The website is meant to be made responsive for mobile, tablets and desktops. It was also supposed to include a header and some other html-semantics. The website should be styled using flexbox and grid.

First i needed to come up with the concept. Then I drew my layout for mobile devices on paper and started adding content in code. I worked my way from top to bottom. I must admit that ChatGPT has helped with a lot of my questions. I have also used Copilot for debugging and Codepen to test out styling. Though the reasoning i did all by myself.

If i hade more time i would make all the links work and build a website with more than one page. I would also like there to be a little icon on the website tab.
